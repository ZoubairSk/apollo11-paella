The Lunar Module **Eagle** was a specialized machine: it wasn’t designed to look good or be aerodynamic, but to operate in an airless environment. Its priorities were **mass efficiency**, **redundancy**, and **control**.

## One vehicle, two opposite tasks

- **Down**: land precisely while managing fuel, speed, and trajectory.
- **Up**: launch from the surface and rendezvous with the Command Module.

## Technology serving operations

Eagle turned an abstract plan into a concrete sequence: separation, descent, landing, exploration, ascent, and docking. In that chain, each system had to respond exactly when required.
