The landing was both technical and human. By that point the mission had already managed thousands of variables—launch, navigation, lunar orbit, separation—but descent concentrated the highest risk into just a few minutes.

## When details matter

During descent, every second counts:

- Altitude and velocity readings
- Fuel management
- Landing site selection
- Clear communication with Mission Control

## More than a historic sentence

The famous first step was possible because of a complete system: training, procedures, redundancies, and an engineering culture built around a key idea: **even the unlikely gets rehearsed**.
