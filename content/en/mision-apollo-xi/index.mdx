Apollo XI was the culmination of a decade of accelerated learning. The mission integrated three critical pieces: a **rocket** powerful enough to leave Earth, a **module** engineered to descend and lift off from the Moon, and a precise **operational sequence** to return safely.

## The mission in one sentence

Launch, travel, enter lunar orbit, **descend**, explore, lift off, dock, return.

## Three lenses to understand it

- **Saturn V**: power and reliability to carry crew and payload.
- **Eagle** (Lunar Module): the vehicle that touched the surface.
- **The landing**: real-time decisions, navigation, and risk control.
