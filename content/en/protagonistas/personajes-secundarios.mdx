When we think of Apollo 11, we picture the lunar surface. But success depended on a huge network: **engineering**, **Mission Control**, **manufacturing**, **telemetry**, **procedures**, **training**, and distributed decision-making.

## Behind the achievement

- **Mission Control** teams coordinating communication and contingencies.
- Systems engineers validating every interface: power, navigation, life support.
- Technicians and suppliers ensuring quality across thousands of components.

## Why “supporting” can be misleading

Without this human infrastructure, Apollo 11 wouldn’t be a feat—it would be a gamble. The extraordinary part was turning it into a **repeatable process**.
