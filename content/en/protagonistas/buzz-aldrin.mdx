Buzz Aldrin (1930– ) was Apollo 11’s **Lunar Module Pilot**. His work blended extreme training with meticulous execution in a vehicle built to operate where there is no slack: vacuum, dust, silence—and numbers.

## A technical role in a historic moment

During Eagle operations, the Lunar Module Pilot helps:

- Monitor systems and procedures
- Verify critical readings
- Keep communication aligned with Mission Control and the commander

## After the Moon

Aldrin also became one of the program’s most visible figures. His story highlights another dimension of Apollo: the human cost and aftermath of a technical triumph.
