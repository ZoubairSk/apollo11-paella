Michael Collins (1930–2021) was Apollo 11’s **Command Module Pilot**. While Armstrong and Aldrin descended, Collins stayed in lunar orbit operating **Columbia**. His work was camera‑invisible, but essential for the mission to end safely.

## The responsibility of waiting—and sustaining

In lunar orbit, Collins had to:

- Keep the spacecraft in optimal condition
- Prepare for rendezvous and docking with the Lunar Module
- Manage procedures and contingencies

## A key reminder

Apollo 11 wasn’t “two men on the Moon”. It was a three‑person system, thousands on Earth, and an architecture of decisions where **redundancy** was part of the design.
