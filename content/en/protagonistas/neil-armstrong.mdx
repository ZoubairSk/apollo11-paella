Neil Armstrong (1930–2012) was the **commander** of Apollo 11 and the first human to walk on the Moon. He’s often reduced to a single historic sentence, but his real contribution was keeping complex decisions calm and clear—especially as the mission entered its most critical phase.

## What defined him

- **Precision**: the mission was a system; Armstrong understood interdependence.
- **Composure**: under pressure, clarity becomes a technical tool.
- **Team-first mindset**: his style avoided personal spotlight.

## Why his role mattered

A commander doesn’t “do everything”, but **decides** when to adjust the plan. During landing, that real-time evaluation was key to touching down safely.
