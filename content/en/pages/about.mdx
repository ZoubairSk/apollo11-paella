This site is a modern rebuild of **Apollo XI Space Race**, focused on **clarity**, **accessibility**, and **navigation**. The goal isn’t to pile up facts, but to guide you through a visual narrative: context → decisions → technology → mission.

## What you’ll find

- **Space Race**: why it emerged, which advances it accelerated, and how it unfolded.
- **Timeline**: key events (1957–1975) to understand “before, during, and after”.
- **Key figures**: the crew and the human infrastructure behind the engineering.
- **Apollo XI mission**: Saturn V, Eagle, and the landing as an operational sequence.

## Editorial approach

- Clear, direct language without losing rigor.
- Short sections that answer “**why it matters**”.
- Optimized for reading on mobile and desktop.
