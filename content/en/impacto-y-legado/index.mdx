The Moon landing wasn’t only a technical success: it had **social**, **cultural**, **scientific**, and **technological** impact. It also raised questions that remain relevant: what should society prioritize, how are innovation benefits distributed, and who gets to steer science?

## Scientific and technological impact

- Accelerated systems engineering: testing, redundancy, risk control.
- Pushed progress in computing, telecommunications, materials, and sensors.
- Strengthened the idea of “impossible” projects executed at scale.

## Social and cultural impact

- Reinforced a global narrative of progress and exploration.
- Reshaped imagination: space became part of popular culture.
- Made scientific work visible, including its limits and human costs.

## Ethical debate (to reflect on)

- How do we weigh historic achievements against urgent needs?
- Who is left out of the story when success is celebrated?
- How do we justify human risk in the name of knowledge?
