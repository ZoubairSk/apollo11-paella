Many breakthroughs that enabled space exploration emerged in military contexts. That doesn’t mean science “belongs” to war, but that wartime efforts created **funding**, **urgency**, and **industrial capacity** to develop technologies later repurposed.

## From missiles to launchers

Rockets evolved from unstable prototypes into systems capable of putting payloads into orbit. The key leap was **reliability**: repeatability, guidance, telemetry, and scalable manufacturing.

## Materials and survival

Coming back from space required:

- Heat‑resistant materials (reentry)
- Life‑support systems (oxygen, temperature, humidity)
- Protection from vibration, vacuum, and radiation

## Computing: the invisible brain

Navigation and mission control depend on continuous computation. The race pushed smaller, more reliable computers—and rigorous testing/verification methods we now associate with modern engineering.
