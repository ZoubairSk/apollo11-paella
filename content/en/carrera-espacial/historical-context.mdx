After World War II, the world reorganized around two major blocs. The rivalry between the **United States** and the **Soviet Union** played out through economics, propaganda, espionage—and also science. Space offered something unique: a highly visible “showcase” to demonstrate capability.

## Space as a message

Each milestone (a satellite, a crewed flight, an orbit, a lunar landing) acted as a **political signal**: “we can build”, “we can compute”, “we can coordinate”. Space technology was closely tied to missiles and military industry, but also to universities and civilian research.

## A race of organization

Beyond rockets, the Space Race tested:

- **Planning** (multi‑year programs)
- **Industrial chains** (thousands of parts and suppliers)
- **Risk management** (failures, loss of life, redesigns)
- **Public communication** (narrative, trust, legitimacy)

That context explains why Apollo XI wasn’t an isolated event, but the outcome of a decade of decisions, funding, and accumulated learning.
