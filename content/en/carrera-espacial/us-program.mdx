The U.S. space program was built in stages. Each had a clear purpose: **learn what was needed** to reach the Moon safely.

## Earlier programs: steps toward Apollo

- **Mercury**: prove humans can fly and return from space.
- **Gemini**: master complex operations (rendezvous/docking, spacewalks, longer stays).
- **Apollo**: integrate everything into a crewed lunar mission.

## Engineering as a culture

Apollo wasn’t just rocket power; it was a culture of testing, documentation, and continuous improvement. Apollo XI became the visible result of many successes—and also incidents that forced redesigns in hardware, procedures, and training.
